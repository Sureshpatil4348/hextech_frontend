              No, the AURUM is designed for both beginners and experienced traders. Complete setup guides are provided, and our WhatsApp community is always there to help you. However, I recommend watching some of my YouTube tutorials to understand basic trading concepts.

            <p className="text-[#19235d] dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors duration-300">
              The system works with both MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platforms. It&apos;s compatible with most brokers offering gold (XAUUSD) trading. If you&apos;re unsure about your broker, contact me on WhatsApp and I&apos;ll confirm compatibility.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900 dark:text-white transition-colors duration-300">What&apos;s the difference between Silver, Gold, and Diamond packages?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors duration-300">
              Silver allows trading in a single direction (either buy or sell). Gold adds bi-directional trading and enhanced re-entry logic, doubling your profit potential. Diamond includes everything plus advanced customization options like trading schedules, price range limits, and one-click management features.

            <p className="text-[#19235d] dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors duration-300">
              While you can start with as little as $500, I recommend at least $1,000 USD (or equivalent) to fully utilize the grid trading strategy. The system includes position sizing controls to adapt to your account size. Many of my successful students started with accounts between $1,000 - $5,000.

              That&apos;s the beauty of the AURUM â€” it&apos;s fully automated. Once set up, it trades 24/5 while you sleep or work. Most users check results for 5-10 minutes daily. With the Diamond package, you can even set specific trading hours to match your schedule.

            <p className="text-[#19235d] dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors duration-300">
              The system is Works on all pairs including gold, which offers the best volatility and profit potential. However, with a few adjustments, it can be used on major forex pairs as well. I provide setup guidance for other instruments in our community.

              Results vary based on market conditions, account size, and risk settings. On average, my students see 5-15% monthly returns with proper risk management. Some testimonials show higher returns, but these represent experienced traders. Always start conservative and scale up as you gain confidence.
